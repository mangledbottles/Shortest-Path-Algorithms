# Shortest Path Algorithms
- [x] Dijkstra
- [x] Floyd Warshall

## Implementation
These two algorithms are used to solve a Shorted Path predicament.

## Problem
A Contest to Meet (ACM) is a reality TV contest that sets three contestants at three random city intersections. In order to win, the three contestants need all to meet at any intersection of the city as fast as possible.

It should be clear that the contestants may arrive at the intersections at different times, in which case, the first to arrive can wait until the others arrive.

From an estimated walking speed for each one of the three contestants, ACM wants to determine the minimum time that a live TV broadcast should last to cover their journey regardless of the contestantsâ€™ initial positions and the intersection they finally meet. You are hired to help ACM answer this question.

You may assume the following:
- [x] Each contestant walks at a given estimated speed.
- [x] The city is a collection of intersections in which some pairs are connected by one-way streets that the contestants can use to traverse the city.
